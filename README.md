## AC Device Stress Test

### Introduction: 
A stress test was conducted on the AC device at 120V, 60 Hz, with a constant load of 1200W (10 A) for 3 minutes.  Using a PCB with a outer copper weight of only 1 oz.

### Results: 
The device operated without issues, showing no visible burns or melting. However, the AC connectors and components reached very high temperatures, estimated around 90 Â°C.

Conclusions: While the device functioned correctly under limit load, the high temperature of the connectors is concerning and could affect its longevity. It is recommended to improve ventilation and consider using heat-resistant connectors for prolonged operations. 
Additionally, using a PCB with a copper weight of 2 oz or more is advised to enhance thermal management.
