Introduction

The **WiFi Smart Water Pump Controller S1**  is an innovative device 
engineered to provide seamless control of water pumps through WiFi connectivity. 
Designed to integrate effortlessly with the **WiFi Water Level S1**, this controller 
offers a comprehensive solution for managing water levels and automating pump operations. 
Whether for residential, agricultural, or industrial applications, it enables efficient and remote 
management of water systems.

Please note that this is an incomplete ongoing project. I am moving it from a working project on the development board to 
certified production chips and new SMD components, for easy assembly and production.

The project is open source and open hardware, licensed under GPLv3. All hardware, software, and
3D printable components were designed from scratch by me, **Raul Rodriguez Guardo**, and are released 
under the GPLv3 license, allowing for free use and modification.
